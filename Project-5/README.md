## Overview  
The goal of this project was to identify **top-performing and underperforming products** to guide marketing and inventory decisions. I analyzed a year’s worth of product-level sales data, ranking each SKU by **revenue, units sold, and gross margin contribution**.  

This work provided the client with a clear understanding of where to focus promotions and which products may require strategic changes, bundling, or discontinuation.

## Approach  
1. **Data Preparation** – Cleaned and formatted product-level sales data for accurate aggregation.  
2. **Metric Selection** – Calculated total revenue, units sold, and gross margin contribution per product.  
3. **Ranking & Segmentation** – Used pivot tables to identify:  
   - **Top 10 products** by revenue  
   - **Top 10 products** by units sold  
   - **Highest-margin products**  
4. **Monthly Performance View** – Created month-over-month tracking for key SKUs.

## Key Insights  
- **Concentration of Sales** – Top 10 products accounted for over X% of total annual revenue, suggesting targeted marketing could yield high returns.  
- **High Unit / Low Margin SKUs** – Several products sold in high volume but had low profit margins, creating opportunities for price optimization or cost reduction.  
- **Seasonality Trends** – Certain SKUs spiked in specific months, highlighting seasonal demand patterns that can be leveraged for campaign planning.

## Impact  
The analysis provided clear, data-backed recommendations for:  
- **Refining promotional strategy** to focus on high-margin, high-revenue products.  
- **Inventory planning** to ensure adequate stock for seasonal best-sellers.  
- **Product portfolio review** to evaluate continuation or discontinuation of low-margin items.
