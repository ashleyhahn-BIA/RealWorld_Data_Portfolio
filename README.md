# Real-World Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my real-world data projects portfolio! This collection highlights hands-on freelance and independent projects I’ve completed outside of formal training. These projects focus on solving real business problems using data storytelling, financial modeling, marketing analytics, and customer behavior insights.

| Project Number | Title                                                                 | Description |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1              | [Margin & Promo Performance Analysis](./Project-1/README.md)         | A real-world margin analysis for an e-commerce brand, including a breakdown of product-level profit margins and evaluation of June promotional sales impact. Built in Excel with actionable insights and visual storytelling. |
| 2              | [New vs Returning Customer Behavior Breakdown](./Project-2/README.md)| A customer analysis project comparing new vs. returning buyers over time to identify behavioral trends, CAC impact, and revenue sources. Visualized in Power BI with month-over-month performance tracking. |
| 3              | [Customer Segmentatioin Analysis](./Project-3/README.md) |An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing customer demographics, regional buying patterns, and cuisine preferences. Highlights high-value segments, top-performing product categories, and urban vs. rural order trends to drive targeted marketing and retention strategies.|
| 4              | [Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Tracking & Reforecasting](./Project-4/README.md)                         | [Placeholder for next freelance or practice project you add.] |
| 5              | [Product Performance Insights](./Project-5/README.md) | The goal of this project was to identify top-performing and underperforming products to guide marketing and inventory decisions. I analyzed a year’s worth of product-level sales data, ranking each SKU by revenue, units sold, and gross margin contribution. This work provided the client with a clear understanding of where to focus promotions and which products may require strategic changes, bundling, or discontinuation. |
| 6              | [Predictive Spend Cut Impact Analysis](./Project-6/README.md)                         | I modeled the business impact of reducing paid media spend across multiple cut sizes to quantify the true cost of cutting acquisition. The analysis goes beyond short‑term savings to include lost customers, revenue, and profit—both initial (first purchase) and lifetime (CLTV)—so leadership could compare “savings” vs. value destroyed. |
| 7              | [Predictive Growth Modeling](./Project-7/README.md)                         | [Placeholder for next freelance or practice project you add.] |
