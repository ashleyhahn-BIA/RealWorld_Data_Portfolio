# Predictive Spend Cut Modeling

---

## Project Overview
I modeled the business impact of **reducing paid media spend** across multiple cut sizes to quantify the **true cost of cutting acquisition**. The analysis goes beyond short‑term savings to include **lost customers, revenue, and profit**—both **initial (first purchase)** and **lifetime (CLTV)**—so leadership could compare “savings” vs. **value destroyed**.

## Why This Matters
Paid media fuels new customer acquisition today **and** tomorrow’s returning revenue. A cut can look good on the P&L short term, but once you account for **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**, the math flips: each dollar cut often destroys multiple dollars in future revenue and profit.

## Methodology
1. **Inputs**
   - Blended **CAC** from YTD performance  
   - **AOV** (Average Order Value)  
   - **Profit Margin** (for contribution profit)  
   - **CLTV multiplier** (repeat purchases, subscriptions)

2. **Scenario math (6‑month window)**
   - **Customers lost** = Spend cut ÷ CAC  
   - **Initial revenue loss** = Customers lost × AOV  
   - **Initial profit loss** = Initial revenue loss × Margin  
   - **Lifetime revenue loss** = Initial revenue loss × CLTV  
   - **Lifetime profit loss** = Lifetime revenue loss × Margin

3. **Outputs**
   - Side‑by‑side **$700K cut** and **$1M cut**  
   - **Initial vs. lifetime** financial impact  
   - Clear visuals + an “executive takeaway” for each scenario

## Key Results 
- **$1,000,000 Cut (6 months)**
  - ~**30,498** fewer new customers  
  - **Initial loss:** ~$2.0M revenue, ~$1.2M profit  
  - **Lifetime loss:** ~$11.8M revenue, ~$7.1M profit  
  - **Takeaway:** Short‑term “savings” are outweighed by long‑term value destruction.

- **$700,000 Cut (6 months)**
  - ~**21,348** fewer new customers  
  - **Initial loss:** ~$1.4M revenue, ~$0.84M profit  
  - **Lifetime loss:** ~$8.2M revenue, ~$4.95M profit  
  - **Takeaway:** A smaller cut still erodes future growth and subscription value.

## Business Impact
- Reframed “spend cuts” as **value trade‑offs**, giving leadership a dollar‑for‑dollar view of **savings vs. future revenue destroyed**.  
- Informed budget decisions by quantifying how cuts impact **next‑year targets** (fewer acquired customers now → smaller base of repeat buyers later).  
- Helped preserve **subscription growth** by showing the outsized long‑term profitability of acquired customers.
