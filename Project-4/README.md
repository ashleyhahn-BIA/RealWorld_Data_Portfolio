# Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Tracking & Reforecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and reforecasts Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) for one of my e-commerce clients, focusing on marketing efficiency and spend optimization across multiple ad channels.  
The goal was to help leadership understand the current trajectory of CAC, identify risks, and model future scenarios to support data-driven budget decisions.

## 🎯 Business Challenge
The company’s marketing spend was spread across Meta, Google, and other paid channels without a clear, updated view of:
- Blended CAC trends
- Channel-specific CAC performance
- How changes in spend could impact efficiency and profitability

Leadership needed **accurate, up-to-date CAC tracking** and **forward-looking projections** to determine if the current spend strategy could sustain growth targets.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Impact
- **Blended CAC was rising** due to increased spend without proportional new customer growth, signaling diminishing returns.
- Certain channels maintained **efficient CAC**, while others showed rapid cost increases, providing a basis for reallocation.
- Modeled scenarios showed that **without adjustments, CAC would continue to increase**, risking profitability goals.
- Recommended **strategic budget reallocation** toward higher-performing channels, helping reduce projected blended CAC in the reforecast model.
