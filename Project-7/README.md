# Predictive Growth Modeling – 10% & 17% Spend Increase

---

## Project Overview
I developed two **predictive growth models** to quantify the revenue, profit, and customer acquisition impact of **increasing paid media spend** by **10%** and **17%**.  
The models compared each growth scenario to **current YTD performance**, showing leadership how increased acquisition spend functions as a **strategic investment** that compounds over time through **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**.

This work was delivered in both **Excel** (for calculation transparency) and **Power BI** (for leadership-ready visuals and interactive filtering).

## Why This Matters
In paid media strategy, incremental budget increases aren’t just about “more ads.”  
They directly drive:
- **More new customers** → larger base for repeat purchases & subscriptions
- **Higher long-term revenue** → fueled by CLTV
- **Faster path to profit targets** → compounding growth from retained customers

By modeling both scenarios, I gave leadership the ability to:
- Compare **investment vs. return** in clear dollar terms
- See **short-term & long-term financial impact**
- Understand how these increases support **next-year growth goals**

## Methodology

### 1. Inputs
- Current **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Profit Margin** (contribution profit)
- **CLTV Multiplier** (based on repeat order rate & subscriptions)
- Current **YTD Spend, Revenue, Profit, and Customer Acquisition**

### 2. Scenario Math
For each growth scenario:
- **Additional Spend** = Current Spend × Increase %
- **Additional Customers** = Additional Spend ÷ CAC
- **Initial Revenue** = Additional Customers × AOV
- **Initial Profit** = Initial Revenue × Margin
- **Lifetime Revenue** = Initial Revenue × CLTV Multiplier
- **Lifetime Profit** = Lifetime Revenue × Margin

### 3. Outputs
- Side-by-side **Current vs. 10% Increase** and **Current vs. 17% Increase**
- KPIs for **customers, revenue, and profit**
- Separate **initial** and **lifetime** impact metrics
- Visualized in **Power BI** for clarity

## Key Results

### 10% Spend Increase
- **+7,865** customers acquired  
- **Initial gain:** +$518K revenue, +$311K profit  
- **Lifetime gain:** +$3.07M revenue, +$1.84M profit  
- **Takeaway:** Modest spend increase yields strong return, more than 6× payback over customer lifetime.

### 17% Spend Increase
- **+13,370** customers acquired  
- **Initial gain:** +$880K revenue, +$528K profit  
- **Lifetime gain:** +$5.21M revenue, +$3.13M profit  
- **Takeaway:** Larger increase drives exponential lifetime impact, accelerating path to revenue and profit goals.

## Business Impact
- Positioned **spend increases** as **long-term growth investments** rather than short-term expenses
- Enabled leadership to choose between **conservative** and **aggressive** growth paths
- Supported budget decisions by showing the **compounding CLTV effect** of new customer acquisition
- Delivered **both Excel models** (calculation transparency) and **Power BI dashboards** (executive presentation-ready)
